## Notes

My challenge while building the app was getting the emulator to work. Despite following the directions presented on the slides, Android Studio kept telling me that my device was "terminated." I fixed it, out of sheer luck, by going into my computer's Task Manager & ending the Android Studio task. It worked from then on, though it was pretty laggy (as you can probably tell in my walkthrough).
